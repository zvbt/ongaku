# おんがく

Hello i'm Cyadine, and I build this website to explore Next.js. I've been wanting to create a project like this for a few months now!
This is a non-profit project dedicated to helping you discover amazing K-Pop and J-Pop music!

## Q&A

Where does the name Ongaku come from?
- Ongaku means music in Japanese. I've been a fan of Asian culture for a few years now, and I thought it would be fun to call it Ongaku.

I found a bug, how can i report it?
- Don't hesitate to open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/zvbt/ongaku/issues) or contact me via email at ongaku@zvbt.space.

I would like to request a song. How to do it?
- You can create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/zvbt/ongaku/issues) with your song requests. If possible, please include links to the songs on YouTube or Spotify for easy reference.

When the playlist are updated?
- Playlists are updated every Sunday at 10PM CEST
